  <h1>Grandaddy â€“ A.M. 180</h1>

  <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
  <p>Don't change your name, keep it the same</p>
  <p>For fear I may lose you again</p>
  <p>I know you won't, it's just that I</p>
  <p>Am unorganized and I wanna find</p>
  <p>You when</p>
  <p>Something good happens</p>

  <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
  <p>If you come down, we'll go to town</p>
  <p>I haven't been there for years</p>
  <p>(And years, and years, and years)</p>
  <p>(And years, and years, and)</p>
  <p>But I'd be fine, wasting our time</p>
  <p>Not doing anything here</p>
  <p>Just doing nothing</p>

  <h2>[Breakdown]</h2>
  <p>We'll sit for days and talk about things</p>
  <p>Important to us like whatever</p>
  <p>We'll defuse bombs, walk marathons</p>
  <p>And take on whatever, together</p>

  <h2>[Outro]</h2>
  <p>Whatever, together</p>
  <p>Whatever, together</p>
  <p>Whatever, together</p>
  <p>Whatever, together</p>
  <p>Whatever, together
