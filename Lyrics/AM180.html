		<p>[Verse 1]
Don't change your name, keep it the same
For fear I may lose you again
I know you won't, it's just that I
Am unorganized and I wanna find
You when
Something good happens

[Verse 2]
If you come down, we'll go to town
I haven't been there for years
(And years, and years, and years)
(And years, and years, and)
But I'd be fine, wasting our time
Not doing anything here
Just doing nothing

[Breakdown]
We'll sit for days and talk about things
Important to us like whatever
We'll defuse bombs, walk marathons
And take on whatever, together

[Outro]
Whatever, together
Whatever, together
Whatever, together
Whatever, together
Whatever, together
